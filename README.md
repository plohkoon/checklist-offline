###Description

This is the second iteration of the notes app that was made for work. It uses a hybrid approach, designed to be an offline application running through electron and an offline database using sqlite3. However it still does open a port externally so it can still be used as a web app

###Get started

On first install run "npm install" and then "npm run rebuild" to get dependencies all right and proper and properly setup for Electron

To run a test version of the program run "npm start" in admin CMD prompt

To package the software run "npm run make-app"
